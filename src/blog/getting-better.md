<!-- ## Getting Better -->

I made it 5 rounds with what I perceived to be an outstanding company, just to
lose grasp of the opportunity in the bottom of the 9th inning. I survived the

1) Recruiter Call
2) HackerRank Challenge, 
3) Technical Presentation, 
4) Cultural Fit Interview,

and got slightly tied up on the 

5) Pair Programming Interview.

I was extremely confident that the job was in the bag, but hearing that they 
were opening recruitment for the role back up and to apply again in 6 months
was a bit humbling. Even just a slight stumble from anxiety or unfamiliarity
with the code was enough to stop me.

After moping around for the day, a new fire was lit under me. I am now back at
the drawing board and correcting my discrepancies. Honestly speaking, I was 
quite aware how weak my logic was beforehand. I've been doing the necessary things
to get better, but was mixing it with building projects.

Now, I'm dedicating a few hours daily to getting stronger, starting with Leetcode.
I'm doing two problems daily and going from there. I was so against pounding LeetCode,
but I'm now intrigued and excited to see how I turn out on the other side.

Being a bootcamp grad, you don't do a ton of learning about algorithms and data
structures, which are obviously a key part of programming, so now I'm playing
catch up and looking to build on top of the skillset that App Academy provided
me with.

Unoffically, It's been 3.5 months that I've been on the market, and let me tell
you, it's not a market in favor of brand new Software Developers. Not one to complain,
so I just have to continue working hard. At this point, I'm closer to getting an
opportunity than I was 3.5 months ago.

If you're in my position or a similar role, stay strong, study hard, and stay
positive!
