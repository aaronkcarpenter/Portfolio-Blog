<!-- ## A Scraper & A Bot -->

Hey guys! How's everyone? I feel great! That little bump in the road motivated
me to get better. I really don't like LeetCode, but I've implemented it daily
going forward, until I find employment at least. What I am quite excited about
though is learning again. I have been quite interested in web scrape, automation,
and bots for a while.

Today, I finally sat down and knocked out a Stock Price scraper as well as a new
Twitter Bot. I didn't put the credentials on Github this time (crosses fingers).
All in all it took about 8 hrs to get it all done. Going forward, I actually plan
to make the Stock Price Scraper a bot that posts to Twitter daily.

For the projects, I utilized the Twitter API, Google Sheets API acting as my 
database to store tweets/stock prices, JavaScript, Cheerio, and Fetch to acquire
current prices. Things are going really well with the project and I'll keep the
site updated with changes as they are made.
